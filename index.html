                <p> Hello, my name is Carlos Arévalo, I'm 27 years old, and I live in Boyacá. <br>I am a student at SENA studying Software Analysis and Development. <br> I was born in the department of Cauca, Since I was a child, I always wanted to be a soldier, a soccer player, or a cyclist. <br>
                Being a cyclist or a soccer player didn't work out, but I did become a soldier, and after completing my military service, I was awarded the "JUAN BAUTISTA SOLARTE OBANDO" medal<br> 
                I have worked in various fields, such as carpentry, shoemaking, painting, and other trades. <br> 
                Currently, I work in agriculture, which is a job I enjoy, but the salary is low, and the work is somewhat denigrated, although it shouldn't be. <br>
                I have thought about creating some projects that could improve agriculture if implemented correctly. <br>
                I'm interested in learning English because it would open doors for me to work in a good company abroad or allow me to work remotely for a foreign company. <br>
                In school, I learned and memorized basic English, but I learned more by translating messages I sent to a girlfriend from England. <br>
                Now, I have resumed my English studies as a personal challenge and due to my studies at SENA. <br>
                I decided to create the blog from scratch to revisit what I have learned about programming. <br> 
                I know it's not well-structured as it's static, and the design is not my strong suit, but it fulfills its purpose.

            however, it is still a short self-introduction video. <br>In it, I practice my English by talking about some aspects of my life such as my hobbies, age, profession, and studies.

            <p>
            Nowadays it is important if you want to be well informed to consult different news media to obtain different points of view. <br>
            since when consulting the traditional media, they are supporters of some political sector in the country. If you blindly trust them you will be a victim of misinformation or you will be informed of the truth to a certain extent. <br><br>
            Example regarding the war between Israel and Palestine. <br><br>
            This conflict was initially addressed by the traditional media as a terrorist act by the Palestinians and a legitimate military response by Israel <br>
            Initially, the media and social networks presented biased or incomplete narratives supporting Israel's military response, but without providing full historical context or addressing the human rights violations and suffering of the Palestinian population, especially children. <br><br>
            This is where the importance of critical thinking arises to analyze the coverage of this conflict objectively. <br>
            Israel's response was expected and in a certain sense, logical, but that response has turned into a war that wants to exterminate Palestinians, regardless of whether they are women, children or the elderly. <br><br>
            It is important to question these narratives, since most of them came from media allied with Israel. <br><br>
            Although as the days passed, certain major media outlets began to show the reality of the conflict, and there was no longer as much support for Israel. <br><br>
            If we had stayed with the version of a single media outlet and it had omitted information on the number of innocent deaths in this conflict, legitimizing the Israeli offensive. We would have assumed that was the truth. <br>
            We must be responsible when consuming and sharing information about this conflict, and thus we can avoid being manipulated and contribute to a more objective and peaceful understanding of the conflict, since the victims of this conflict, beyond their religion and political ideology, are human beings. . . <br>
            In an issue as complex as this conflict, critical thinking and media literacy are essential tools to separate facts from misinformation.

        <h1>Crime and Punishment</h1>
        <div class="texto-compañia">
            <p>
                "Crime and Punishment" and today's society <br><br>
                Fyodor Dostoevsky 1821-1881, wrote in 1866 a novel that has become a classic: "Crime and Punishment." <br>
                This novel delves into the moral and psychological complexities surrounding a criminal act committed by its protagonist Rodion Raskolnikov. <br>
                The plot revolves around the murder of a pawnbroker by Raskolnikov, a brilliant but impoverished student. <br>
                Whoever, motivated by a theory that justified the crime if it was done for a higher cause, ends up murdering Aliona the moneylender and her sister,
                Raskolnikov ends up succumbing to the remorse that haunts him,
                After a while and on the advice of his girlfriend Sonia, he decides to end his torment and declare murder, being sentenced to prison in Siberia. <br><br>
                In this novel Dostoevsky explores themes such as guilt, repentance and redemption. that can lead to extreme misery and is also inspired by or portrays some of his own experiences in the novel, such as having been imprisoned in Siberia. <br>
                Currently we still have levels of economic inequality and the occurrence of crimes due to continuous necessity,
                The conditions of poverty, desperation and lack of opportunities that drove Raskolnikov can be observed today in many vulnerable social strata. <br>
                Nothing justifies a murder, but the novel invites us to reflect on the factors that can lead human beings to commit criminal acts and as a society we are not doing what is necessary to avoid these situations that end in tragedies. <br>
                Crime and Punishment is a novel that portrays the darkest shadows of the human condition and questions our role as a society in avoiding these heinous acts. <br><br>
                "Confession is the first step towards penance, towards freedom from guilt." - Fyodor Dostoevsky.
